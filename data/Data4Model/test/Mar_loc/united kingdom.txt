As fucked up as this is there is nothing in China for me Pricks keep eating dog rats and bats
In queue outside the pharmacy right now meters apafrom each other and an old guy three people ahead of me can be heard blaming the Chinese for Covid because they eat dogs and bats followed by many racists slurs and they say respect your elders Wow 8JWyuZPQFJ
Ive seen lot of jokes about how COVID was started because of someone eating bat and Ive just got to say it feels like dog whistle racism alluding to perceptions that Chinese people eat anything
Over the last twenty years how many deadly viruses have originated from China wet markets The places where street stalls have dead dogs cats rats and bats for sale iPhones and pandemics the China of today COVID
getting some folk talking about Covid being bioweapon
If it were it be the most counter productive weapon in military history It leaves fighting aged men alive and kills off those that in war planning are drain Also west will pull manufacturing from China
angry to hear that this COVID virus likely came from the wet markets in Wuhan China because of their perverted taste for wild exotic animals and of course dogs cats heartbroken that all these deaths across the world could have been avoided if not for these markets
Judyannne Bluestockingmum McCartneyMaxwel judith Did Chinese people eat chuffing illegal bat meat Yep Is that how COVID became transmissible between humans Yep
do blame China but this pandemic started with grossly irresponsible behaviour in Wuhan

PDChina ScienceMagazine The big mistake with Covid was that world govs did boycott trade with China and other Asian countries until the disgusting cruel wildlife markets dog and cat meat trades and all heinous animal cruelty had stopped This has happened because of your greedy lust for torture
The Chinese communist party
Threatened to arrest the doctor who first identified coronavirus
Destroyed lab test results and lied about how the virus spreads
Promoted baseless conspiracy theories
Arrested those who spoke out
But sure They re the good guys here
