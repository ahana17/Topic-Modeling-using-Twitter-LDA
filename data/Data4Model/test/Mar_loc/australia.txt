EVERYONE BURYING THE EVIDENCE
Did China Close First Lab To Sequence Covid Out Of Fear It Would Lose Bat Soup Narrative Zero Hedge 0LGr6UQ
CarnivoreMD The fear should be in overreaction to said threat that actually leads to shortages of stuff we need to survive and thrive China is back to model of enforced veganism to fight pandemic because of overreaction to Swine flu amp CV

Qlder Shit that ai good for timsout
So what is timsout meant to eat now that China has ban eating cats and dogs
vanbadham Lets not forget this virus was grown in CHINA from stolen wildlife shoved together in awful wet markets Then when the virus was identified by doctors it was covered upCHINA is where the mishandling of Covid originated and the world will pay for it
macsweenprue 60Mins Channel They play paat the point of crossing speciesin this case wet meat market in Wuhan Chinait is relevant here There is case to work with countries to avoid the birds and bats and pigs all together in these dirty markets try and change the way they trade But not here
It all started because some dopey and inhumane cunt decided it was good idea to eat bat soup in some unregulated filthy wet market in China Wuhan coronavirus coronavirusau toiletpaperpanic asx
The corona virus will only kill old people and babies make you infertile and cook your organs You can catch it again after getting over it and that when you die It was made by evil communist Chinese in communist lab for population control So stop freaking out
Is it racist to apportion blame to the country who catch kill and eat wild animals including bats dogs donkeys civet cats pangolins And send entire threatened species into extinction It originated in China thats fact 0nmVb3CVv
Well not sure about that initially it was from wild animals they eat though think accidental leak would make more sense China couldnt lay straight in bed cant be trusted BUT do like the people just not their politics 3udSZYNeB
Fankuai Dog Meat need to be dealt now PDChina China WHO its these kinds of evil greedy scum that need to be made sure they do not get away with this they torture animals amp risk more viral outbreaks killthetrade coronavirus WuhanVirus COVIDー
And we have to thank the Chinese for selling amp eating animals that no human should eat for coronavirus They eat tiger penis amp shark fin pushing those species to extinction amp Pangolin the cause of this pandemic Also bats Really this shit has to stop Covid
Is world acknowledgment of science that coronavirus originated in Chinese wet markets only fuelling nationalistic backlash Company claims eating dogs shows cultural confidencehow this could end up not being win for animals 8HOijnptd6 via MailOnline
Bull Shit Chinese Propaganda alright Wuhan was source of coronavirus where virus jumped to humans thru bat soup amp eating raw or exotic animals auspol
adampeacock RitaPanahi We all should give fuck
Watch this Vox video on COVID

Pressure needs to be put on China to STOP their wet markets
They re unethical and utterly filthy
The communist regime enables it because the powerful eat the wild creatures as status symbol
Calling the Coronavirus The China Virus is not racist
It came from China Not from Compton amp why are people eating bats
WE SHOULDNT HAVE TO PAY CHINA ANYTHING AFTER THIS
Coronavirus jumped from pangolin or fruit bat while it was being prepared for eating
Its common in China and SE Asia to breed wild and domesticated animals for people to eat
Probably when coronavirus infected the person it mutated so theres no defence and no vaccine
CJisnowblue From Australia yes the USA is shithole with the world worst medical system Since WW2 million civilians have died from America wars hope China growing power will end American military aggression
Lana 3YearLetterman realDonaldTrump Its Chinese virus because corona origin is from China You ppl should stop eating rats bats cats dogs The world is suffering because of you lot Not all Chinese though The Chinese government Atleast from now should initiate and ban such extreme activity of eating animals
Chinese caused CoronaVirus Noone else did gt Vile Wet Markets sellingcookingeating all sorts of exotic animals gt bat soup live mice caused the virus to jump to humans gt Communist Chinese Govt propagates outright Lies to cover its responsibility for this pandemic auspol 0gW7s

shadihamid TheAtlantic Is the practice of illegal animal trade in Chinese wet markets also to blame Or would that be considered racist coronavirus
Chinese apologize because they may not be aware of hygiene amp spread coronavirus

Oof this misinformation avout COVID is pissing me off
This virus did start from China it was first reported in Wuhan meaning China happened to be the first to notice
It was likely that the virus transmitted from bats to some animal people eat Not from dumb soup
zlj GOOD China should be paying each country million dollars YOU HAVE STUFFED UP THE WORLD BY eating wild bloody animalsChina SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE amp FINED This is why see video below

See video below says it all
chinavirus
Does anyone believe the theory that the Chinese deliberately released this virus from lab
Or did they just eat bat soup
AOC China are responsible Period The CCP for lying and concealing the evidence and murdering the scientist who found it and the people who actively and willingly eat these disease ridden animals
The rest of us are just trying to catch up
What are we to make of reports Covid may have come from Chinese military lab There have been enough lies from the communists in Beijing to warrant major rethink of our relations with totalitarianism And by the way realDonaldTrump is not racist 3vAePwWMz
zlj Yeah totally Great investigative work obedient Communist lemming Must be bat soup oclock now WuhanVirus MadeInChina WuFlu FuckChina 2cyfp1Ktj
UNNTV This appears to be hoax for China haters to hate China on by Chinese as trickThere may be cases where they eat dogs or cats but they would kill the animal first before cooking which has NOT happened here In France horse meat is usual at butchers Gullible Wuhan Covid
TBH fuck China how you gonna lie like that already hate your dog meat festival and your low quality products when can we vote china off the earth Aliens dont wanna come here its not coz we dumb they afraid you gon eat them Thanks China 3QDFJGXb
WallWallme LipstickLover washingtonpost It came from China Are you denying that The Chinese wet markets they eat live animals cut chunks of flesh of living dogs and cook it amp leave these innocent animals in pain and living life of hell My country is in ruins Please Truth It comes from cruel china

China does get the world is going to blame them for CV Their proactive PR is the worst in history Racism is evil but can see tsunami heading China way for the next several decades You ate bats We died predict this will be the sentiment auspol coronavirusaus
billbowtell abcnews Look forward to the blame you place on the Chinese Communist Party Published on March on RCP Beijing fears COVID is turning point for China globalisation details the role of Chinas leadership in initially covering up the virus and now spreading disinformation about it
RealMarkLatham PaulineHansonOz since when do you listen to the Chinese there liars and cruel to animals say boycott all Chinese stuff that never is any good only lasts few daysif that they killed doctor that new about this virus
Raymartin realDonaldTrump China virus If Australians were the ones eating bats and not the usual farm meats and we had the first infections and delayed telling the world about it then it would be the Australian virus China deserves some blame
Wow This white dude decides to educate us AsianAustralians on how we should be eating bats This racism is going beyond the joke and its Aussie politics and tabloid media which is to blame Evidence shows COVID did not stem from eating bats coronavirusaustralia
What joke WHO is proving to be We should we trust these UN propaganda idiots with our and our loved ones lives
The China communist party lied and people died while WHO has backed them all the way 6IL
Hear me out
China IS to blame for Covid
Not from exotic meat trade or wet markets or economical warfare
Pandas
Giant fucking pandas
They dont want to live These pandas have been trying to get themselves extinct for 100s of years amp were the only thing standing in their way
ASPIorg Antipodemia Disagree with Mark Beeson Antipodemia on his assumption that the threat from China is its rapidly expanding military power but COVID and that we ve been preparing to fight the wrong war
China re opens its wet market with bats and dogs on sale The whole world is dying and they are ready with corona coronavirus coronavirusau Covid Coronavirustruth
World goes into deep depression
Blame on China make them pay
